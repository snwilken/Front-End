 
# Eventual Web Application

Eventual Event Finder is an application for managing and searching various types of concerts and social events. Users can filter event searches by location and tags. In addition, users can add events to their favorites, view event information, and locations on interactive maps. The application allows users to behave like administrators by creating new events and managing their own events. Users interact through a client-side application which consumes web services, that provide business logic and access to a database.
